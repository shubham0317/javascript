📘 Email & Password Validator – JavaScript Practice Project

This project is a focused JavaScript practice application built to strengthen my understanding of form validation, regular expressions, and real-time input handling using Vanilla JavaScript.

Instead of only validating inputs using HTML attributes, this project implements custom validation logic to deeply understand how JavaScript handles user input in real-world scenarios.

🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

Practice JavaScript form validation

Understand regular expressions (RegEx)

Improve DOM manipulation skills

Strengthen event handling concepts

Handle real-time user input

Build logical thinking

Write cleaner and more structured validation code
